# Memory Game Project

## Start

Just open the index.html file and start playing!

## The game

- Click on a card to start the game (That starts the timer, so be quick afterwards!).
The symbol on that card will now be displayed.
- Click on another card to see that card's symbol. If they match they'll remain up, if not they will be face down again.

The game ends when all pair of cards are matched.

## Game interface

Above of the cards there's the score panel. It shows:

- Star rating (1-3): It shows a star rating based on number of moves and time spent to solve the game.
  - 3 stars: < 16 moves or < 1 min
  - 2 stars: > 16 moves or >= 1 min
  - 1 star: > 24 moves or >= 2 min
- Moves: Number of moves
- Timer: Time spent since first card clicked
- Reset button: Resets the game

## Dependencies

The game uses JQuery (from CDN) & Bootstrap (.min files)
